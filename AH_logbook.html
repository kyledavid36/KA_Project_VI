  <h2>Week 1: STM32CubeIDE Setup and Initial CAN Communication</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 6th – May 10th, 2025</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Installed STM32CubeIDE and created a project using STM32 F303RE Nucleo board.</li>
    <li>Configured GPIO and NVIC settings as per CUBE IDE guide.</li>
    <li>Assigned GPIO pins to onboard LEDs and pushbuttons.</li>
    <li>Generated base project code using STM32 HAL libraries.</li>
    <li>Wrote and tested CAN transmit and receive functions.</li>
    <li>Verified functionality by pressing blue pushbutton to activate green LED on both boards for 2 seconds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Week 2: Code Testing, Elevator Verification, and Remote Access</h2>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 11th – May 16th, 2025</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tested Part 2 code for LED logic and floor selection through pushbuttons.</li>
    <li>Verified CAN transmission and elevator weight movement to correct floors.</li>
    <li>Installed and configured TigerVNC for remote access to Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Connected to Pi using provided server ID and IP address.</li>
    <li>Accessed GUI for elevator control and tested floor commands remotely.</li>
    <li>Drew initial GUI layout and refined it after project feedback.</li>
    <li>Confirmed reliable LAN communication with Raspberry Pi.</li>
    <li>Contributed to documentation: updated Test Plan, Status Report, and Project Plan Spreadsheet.</li>
